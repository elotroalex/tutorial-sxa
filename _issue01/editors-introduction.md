The articles in this first issue of *sx archipelagos* attend to the
myriad opportunities and concerns that inform the Caribbean digital---its
spaces, methodologies, and imaginations---as praxis and as historicized
societal phenomenon. Contributors propose critical perspectives on the
challenges and opportunities presented by media technologies that
evermore intensely reconfigure the social and geographic contours of the
Caribbean. The majority of the essays were generated from a broad public
conversation initiated in 2014 in [The Caribbean Digital
I](https://wayback.archive-it.org/1914/20151224034027/http://caribbeandigital.cdrs.columbia.edu/),
a conversation to which we returned in 2015 with [The Caribbean Digital
II](http://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/2015/) and which we intend to
continue far into the future. Over the course of these two events,
participants engaged with the so-called digital humanities in the
so-called global South as an ethical, political, social, and creative
phenomenon. The sustained reflections offered by our contributors very
much illustrate the premises we laid out in these public forums. They
are attentive to both the possibilities and the constraints of the
technologies they evoke, and they consider the ways the Internet does
and does not provide structural means for facilitating broad engagement,
communication, and accessibility in the Caribbean.

In "Digitizing the 'Sound Explosions' of Anglophone Caribbean
Performance Poetry," Janet Neigh engages questions of archival best
practices, audience, and representation in an insightful discussion of
Trinidad's youth-led artist collective the 2 Cents Movement. What, Neigh
asks, are the costs and the benefits of relying on the digital for the
crucial functions of preserving and circulating Caribbean poetry and
other forms of oral and performance art? And how does the relatively new
performance platform that is the Internet shed light on the politics of
preservation and circulation? Similarly, in "Twitter and @douenislands's
Ambiguous Paths," Jeannine Murray-Romàn considers how Caribbean artistic
movements---in this instance, the Trinidadian-based Douen Islands
Project---embrace digital technology and social media in their efforts to
connect with and implicate a wide and diverse audience. Murray-Romàn's
"Twitter-focused analysis" explores figurings of the folk---of the *douen*
in particular---in both the substance and the practice of reading (in) the
Caribbean. Both Neigh and Murray-Romàn affirm the digital as space
wherein, despite myriad and significant challenges, artists and/as
social actors are able to connect and collaborate transregionally. Also
concerned with technology and the arts in the increasingly digitized
Caribbean space, Martin Munro interrogates the relationship between
music and digital media in "Who Stole the Soul? Rhythm and Race in the
Digital Age." Munro considers whether the affordances of technology risk
endangering the originary radicalism of black music. Might the digital
chance making rhythm accessible to global beat-makers in a troublingly
race-and-history-free vacuum?

Tonya Haynes's essay, "Mapping Caribbean Cyberfeminisms," also thinks
about expanded opportunities for connection and community building
throughout the (cyber)space of the Caribbean and its diasporas. Focused
specifically on the phenomenon of online feminist activism, Haynes
situates and critiques the vast network of feminist bloggers whose media
presence at once forges new political paths and shores up the work of
existing on-the-ground activist communities. Finally, mapping is at the
heart of Yarimar Bonilla and Max Hantel's "Visualizing Sovereignty:
Cartographic Queries for the Digital Age." Reflecting on the ways formal
representation is deeply connected to and even determinant of
philosophical and political phenomena, Bonilla and Hantel ask how
sovereignty in the Caribbean might be generatively reimagined through
attention to visualization. From infographics to animation, the authors
experiment with cartography as dynamic scholarly praxis through which to
challenge existing hierarchies of nationhood.

"The Caribbean Digital" is, of course, a complex and unbounded space---one
that we have only begun to explore in this special section. It is our
hope that this wide-ranging and interdisciplinary collage of
interventions will provide a rich point of departure for ongoing
discussion of the political, ethical, and theoretical stakes of the
digital in the Americas.
